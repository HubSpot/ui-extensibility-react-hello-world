This repository contains helpful examples to get started with using React as a front-end UI extensions. This is available only as private beta under [developer beta terms & agreements](https://legal.hubspot.com/developerbetaterms).

Over the last year, we have received invaluable feedback from our beta participants and active community developers about custom cards available through the CRM development beta. We heard loud and clear that you need:

- More flexible & interactive front-end to handle complex use cases
- Developer experience specifically optimized for front-end development.

The feedback and use cases you've shared with us have helped define the exciting next chapter for UI extensibility at HubSpot, and for that, we are deeply grateful. We're thrilled to invite you to participate in a private beta for our new React-based UI extensions. UI extensions will now enable you to build front-end experiences using frameworks like React while continuing to use HubSpotâ€™s serverless functions as needed. This enables you to leverage the active ecosystem and open-source tooling that React is known for.
